    <h1>Saturn - Sixth planet of the solar system</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas
      giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth.[26][27] It has only one-eighth the
      average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[28][29][30] Even though Saturn is nearly the size of
      Jupiter, Saturn has less than one-third of Jupiter's mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434
      million km) with an orbital period of 29.45 years.
    </p>

    <p>Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an
      intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale
      yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen
      layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a
      magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around
      one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[31] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although
      long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).
    </p>

    <p>The planet has a bright and extensive ring system composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of
      rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons[32] are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named;
      this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest
      in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar
      System to have a substantial atmosphere.[33]</p>

  <h2>Name & Symbol</h2>
  <p>
    Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture and father of Jupiter. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has
    been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho ligature with a
    horizontal stroke, as an abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronus), the Greek name for the planet ().[34] It later came to
    look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century to Christianize this pagan
    symbol.
  </p>
  <p>The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day"), for the planet Saturn.[35]
  </p>

  <h2>Physical characteristics
  </h2>
  <p>
    Saturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it is
    likely to have a solid core.[36] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is
    flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial radius is more than 10% larger than its polar
    radius: 60,268 km versus 54,364 km (37,449 mi versus 33,780 mi).[6] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant
    planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate
    means that the effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96 m/s2, is 74% of what it is at the poles and is
    lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape velocity of nearly 36 km/s is much higher
    than that of Earth.[37]
  </p>
  <p>

    Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less.[38] Although Saturn's
    core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69 g/cm3 due to the
    atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth's mass,[39] and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.[6] Together, Jupiter and
    Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.[40]
  </p>

  <h2>Cloud layers</h2>
  <p>Saturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are
    much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter. Saturn's finer
    cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the Voyager spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then,
    Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.[61]

    The composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with
    temperatures in the range of 100–160 K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice.
    Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures
    range from 185 to 270 K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure
    range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235 K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10 and 20 bar
    and temperatures are 270–330 K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.[62]

    Saturn's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter. In
    1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during
    the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm was an example of a Great
    White Spot, a short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, around the
    time of the northern hemisphere's summer solstice.[63] Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933,
    and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the best observed.[64] The latest giant storm was observed in 2010. In 2015,
    researchers used Very Large Array telescope to study Saturnian atmosphere, and reported that they found
    "long-lasting signatures of all mid-latitude giant storms, a mixture of equatorial storms up to hundreds of years
    old, and potentially an unreported older storm at 70°N".[65]

  <p>
    The winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. Voyager data indicate
    peak easterly winds of 500 m/s (1,800 km/h).[66] In images from the Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's
    northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh
    scattering.[67] Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known example of
    such a phenomenon in the Solar System.[68] Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally −185 °C, temperatures on the
    vortex often reach as high as −122 °C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.[68]
